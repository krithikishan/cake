Hi! This is a Microwave Chocolated Mug Cake, and this is one of my favourite recipes because of how easy and quick it is to make! I absolutely love making these, and usually make them every alternate weekend, and they always turn out great! I found this recipe online     ( https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241038/microwave-chocolate-mug-cake )   and tweaked it a little bit so it worked better according to my taste. I hope you like it!
