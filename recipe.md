Step Number One:
Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a large microwave-safe mug; stir in milk, canola oil, water, and vanilla extract.

Step Number Two:
Cook in microwave until cake is done in the middle, about 1 minute 45 seconds. If it isn't done, then let it cool for 5 seconds before popping it back in for a few more. Use a toothpick to see if the batter has cooked in the middle, you'll know if the toothpick comes out dry.
